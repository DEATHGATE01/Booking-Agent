## 🚀 Next Steps for Full Functionality

### 1. 🔑 Add API Keys (Required for AI Features)
Edit the `.env` file and add your LLM API key:

# Choose ONE of these:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key-here
# OR
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key-here
```

### 2. 📅 Setup Google Calendar Integration (Required for Booking)
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing
3. Enable Google Calendar API
4. Create Service Account credentials (download JSON)
5. Save the JSON file as `credentials/service-account-key.json`
6. Share your Google Calendar with the service account email
7. Update `.env` with your calendar ID:
```bash
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=your-calendar-id@gmail.com
```

### 3. 🧪 Test the Application
1. Run: `.\start_simple.ps1`
2. Open: http://localhost:8501
3. Try booking: "Schedule a meeting tomorrow at 2 PM"
